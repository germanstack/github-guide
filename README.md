# Github-guide
This is a guide for all GERMANSTACK learners. Includes approach on how to use GitHub for GERMANSTACK collaboration. 

## Teams

The GERMANSTACK team is designed to aid learners to adopt collaborative work environment as we are concerned with building top-notch developers. A team is expected to complete team challenges as a team. In other words, every member of the team should be carried along,  and is expected to make little contributions to the completion of a project.

### Team Leader 
A team will be nominated by the team. The team leader is been given admin privileges to merge PRs from other team players (i.e. collaborators). A team leader will be voted out if team members collectively agree to a leader being incapacitated to facilitate the affairs of the team. Which includes but not limited to: 

- Merging PRs
- Scheduling team meetings for Group Learning
- Sorting out resources to aid completion of a project
- Assigning task to other team members
- Making team members always feeling part of a team

A team is made up by 5 incredible individuals. All team collaboration on *GERMANSTACK* Github org should ensure to follow the guidelines listed below:

- A team will be created with this format  `german-team-1` and proceeds in this sequence per-cohort. 
- A team is also a repo typically like this: https://germanstack/german-team-1.
- A team is completely independent to think on its own but sticking to the rule of a challenge
- A team's project will be grouped into folders e.g. `germanstack/german-team-1/todo-app` 
- A team (i.e. repo) will be archived at the end of a cohort
- Forking another team's repo is highly discouraged. We encourage collaboration will also discourage copying someone's effort and taking credits for it. 
- A team member can request admin privileges where the team lead is no longer available. Privilege can only be granted on consensus with other team members. 

# Individual 

Your individual code challenge completion sits on your GitHub account but it's required to be prefixed with `german` e.g `german-todo-app`. This makes sorting for your codes a lot easier from the large `todo-app` projects on GitHub. It is also expected of you to complete all challenges. These challenges are to better your skills as a developer, and hel you get used to the GitHub workflow. 

It is also expected every project follows the GitHub-workflow from `staging-to-development-before being merged into-master`.
